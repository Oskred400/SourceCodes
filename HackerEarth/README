This Repository contains programs, which are the solutions to some of the problems on www.hackerearth.com . 

Each problem is in a seperate folder, and each folder has 2 files. One is the program file and the other is the README file.

The README has the link to the problem on HackerEarth website and the percentage result of the problem. Not all the programs have 100% result.

pull requests for codes which are modified to give 100% result are welcome.
